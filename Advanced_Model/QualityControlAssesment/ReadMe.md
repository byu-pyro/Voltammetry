# Quality Control Assessment Tool

The quality control assessment is a developer's tool used to compare iterations of the code. This is done by creating a test folder whose data is generated using a new iteration of the functions.py. Once the data has been generated it is compared to a base set of data to check its performance. In this description, we will explore the structure of this directory, explain the use of each file, and describe the process for conducting an assessment.
