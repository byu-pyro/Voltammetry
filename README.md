# Voltammetry
Contains files to calculate properties from electrochemical measurements (voltammetry) and models of different voltammetry methods

### CV_Diffusion_Coefficient.xlsx
This file can be used to calculate diffusion coefficients for cyclic voltammetry reduction peaks of reactions involving the deposition of metal onto a forgein substrate. This file requires the user to take a few steps and possibly install the solver add-in. Instructions are provided in the file.

### CV_Diffusion_Coefficient.xlsm
This file can be used to calculate diffusion coefficients for cyclic voltammetry reduction peaks of reactions involving the deposition of metal onto a forgein substrate. This file contains macros and requires the user to enbale it, but minimal setup is required. Instructions are provided in the file.
