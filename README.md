# Voltammetry
Contains files to calculate properties from electrochemical measurements (voltammetry) and models of different voltammetry methods

### CV_Diffusion_Coefficient.xlsx
This file can be used to calculate diffusion coefficients for cyclic voltammetry reduction peaks of reactions involving the deposition of metal onto a forgein substrate.  The model assumes semi-infinite linear diffusion only for resersible soluble-insoluble reactions. The model accounts for: (1) reversible reactions, (2) deposition onto a forgeign substrate, (3) digital staircase instead of a true linear scan. This model does not account for uncompensated resistance.

This file requires the user to take a few steps and possibly install the solver add-in. Instructions are provided in the file.
